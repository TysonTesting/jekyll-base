My top 5 favorite things from the list of duties that are expected of support staff:
- Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day
- Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
- Dig through server logs to troubleshoot a customer's website behavior
- Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
- Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have

My top 5 least favorite things from the list of duties that are expected of support staff:
- Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
- Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
- Help manage communications during a service outage
- Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup
- Find and recruit teammates for the support team

My favorite thing about providing technical support is helping people. I love helping people and I love helping people find solutions to problems especially. It also makes me feel smarter than I really am which I appreciate.
