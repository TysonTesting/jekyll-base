Hello John Doe,

I understand that your site won't build.  I'm happy to help you out with that. In order to best assist you, I will need some additional information. If you could respond with the following information it would be incredibly helpful:

<li>Are you using a theme? If so, which theme are you using? </li>
<li>Are you receiving an error message of any kind when trying to deploy your site? If so, what error message are you receiving></li>
<li>Lastly, can you please send me a link to your site, as well as a screenshot of your DNS settings?</li>

I look forward to assisting you further. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you need assistance finding your DNS settings, taking a screenshot, finding out which theme you are using, etc. I'm always here to help.
