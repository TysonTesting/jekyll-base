One of my favorite products currently that is specifically focused for developers is <a href="https://atom.io/docs">Atom</a>.

There are so many reasons why I love this code editor! First of all, it's easily hackable and super customizable with very little effort on the part of the user. There's a bit of a learning curve but Atom is well documented and easy to pick up once you get the hang of it. Tons of built in methods and shortcuts that are also customizable. There are also plenty of third party tools and packages that you can find on places like github.
